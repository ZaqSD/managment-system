# managment-system
## Backend
Dependency Manager: Gradle

Start SpringBoot Application from:
src/main/java/com/siaplaouras/managmentsystem/ManagmentSystemApplication.java

Afterwards the backend is accessible on: localhost:8080
By visiting localhost:8080 in a browser, the contents of the database can be viewed

The database files can be found under ~/db/
If any changes are made to the db-structure in the java-classes the db needs to be updated simulteniously in its console as well.
Alternative is deleting the db-files and restarting the backend.

## Frontend
1. Navigate to '~/views'
2. Execute 'yarn install' to install dependencies
3. Execute 'yarn start' to start application

Application now runs by default on localhost:3000
